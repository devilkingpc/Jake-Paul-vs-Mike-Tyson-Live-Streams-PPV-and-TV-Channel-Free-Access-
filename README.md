Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson are being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.

How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?
Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars "Iron Mike," as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according to Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2013 at the age of 37.

Though promotors have not revealed exactly how much Tyson will earn for Friday's fight, reports from online sources, including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.

That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.
